## What is Duet Mac Display?

Duet Mac Display is a professional screen extension tool that allows you to use your iPad, iPhone, or even another Mac as a high-resolution secondary monitor. Designed specifically for macOS, it delivers seamless performance with Retina-quality graphics and ultra-low latency.

The software works by creating a wired or wireless connection between your devices, turning them into an extended desktop. This is ideal for creative professionals, programmers, and anyone who needs more screen space without investing in additional hardware.

With support for touch and Apple Pencil input, Duet Mac Display also enhances interactivity, making it a versatile tool for drawing, note-taking, and design reviews. It integrates smoothly with popular apps like Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and Xcode.

Optimized for all Mac models—including MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iMac—Duet runs efficiently on both Intel and Apple Silicon chips. It is compatible with macOS Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, and earlier versions.

Whether you’re working from home, in the studio, or on the go, Duet Mac Display offers a reliable and high-quality solution for expanding your digital workspace.
